# Books

# Introduction

Books is an app that allows you to see a list of books, you can also add those books to a wish list so that you can read them later.

Books lets you view your books in two ways, with cards and in a table.

Once you have your books on your wish list and you regret about some books, you can remove books from your list.

Books also lets you add new books, help us collect more books and share them with everyone.

> **_NOTE:_**  This project is responsive, you can see it on your cell phone ðŸ˜„.

> **_NOTE:_** IMPORTANT -> For the api to work you have to download this repository --> (https://github.com/eugenioroblessiller/server). This is very important since the information is not local, I wanted to demonstrate all the steps in the process of a call to an endpoint so I set up a fake server..
